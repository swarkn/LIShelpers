# LIShelpers

[![N|Solid](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-powered-w-140x56.png)](https://www.python.org)

This will be a little collection for some tools, people can use if they / or their beloved ones suffer from "locked-in" syndrom. This project is in a really early state and might not be very usefull at the moment. We want all the tools to be as easy to use as possible. Therefore:

  - Using the tools will be possible with at least only 1 physical body reaction to say "yes"
  - Eyerything is designed for high contrast & big sized fonts
  - Eyerything you might see on the screen, will be read out loud (if you wish so)
  - Less information on the screen is allways more.

The toolset of LIShelpers is written in Python computer language, hosted by the guys of [do-it-neat.com] and [GitHub][github project]. You are able to get support at the [github issues] site.

### Tech

The LIShelpers package uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Tk] - a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk.
* [ImageTk] - support to create and modify Tkinter BitmapImage and PhotoImage objects from PIL images
* [gTTS] - Create an mp3 file from spoken text via the Google TTS (Text-to-Speech) API
* [pyglet] - a cross-platform windowing and multimedia library for Python
* [AVbin] - a cross-platform, thin wrapper around Libavâ€™s video and audio decoding library

And of course the LIShelpers package itself is open source with a [public repository][github project]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

LIShelpers requires [Python](https://python.org/) v3.5.2 to run.

Download and extract the [latest pre-built release](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/).

##### Install LIShelpers on Windows

Install the python package the "typical" way. Please don't forget to put the Python search path into your PATH environment variable.

Open up a command prompt (by starting cmd.exe) and install the necessary Python modules:

```cmd
$ pip install pillow
$ pip install imagetk
$ pip install gtts
$ pip install pyglet
```
Install the binary package of AVbin by downloading and running the [setup file][avbin download]. Please be sure to install the right flavor of AVbin (32/64bit). The version you need, depents on the Python version you are using.

Hint: to get AVbin work properly on Windows 10, copy the files AVbin.dll and/or AVbin64.dll from your Windows/system32 folder into your Windows/WinSxS folder.

##### Install LIShelpers on Linux

Installing LIShelpers on Linux (x86 / x86_64) should work just fine, but is not tested yet. A detailed instructionset will be at this location shortly. Support for the Raspberry Pi project will fast follow.

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

We truly need your help. We are no developers at all and your development skill would come in very handy for the project. :) We're only using the github toolset for developing. Just do a pull request.

### Todos

 - finish the first tool "SimpleSpellMachine"
 - of course: build more usefull tools!
 - work on hardware interfaces
 - add more code comments
 - etc.
